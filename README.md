# symlink-editor
A GTK+ 3 app that helps you work with symbolic links on Linux.

made by tassaron


Works with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4! Probably works with many other versions too but I make no guarantee.


Features:

-Edit a symlink target or rename it

-Copy/duplicate symlinks

-Folder navigation (press icon in location bar to go up)

-Command-line options to integrate the program with another app


For example you can open an 'edit' dialog immediately for a file with:

symlink-editor -edit /path/to/file

Which could be used in a right-click context menu for example...
