A GUI Symlink Editor for Linux. Uses GTK+ 3.

Works with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4! Probably works with earlier and later versions too but I make no guarantee.

NOTE: The .desktop file in this repo is just a template provided; it must be edited to have a valid filepath to Symlink Editor.


Features:
--------------

- Edit a symlink target or rename it

- Copy/duplicate symlinks

- Folder navigation (press icon in location bar to go up)

- Command-line options to integrate the program with another app


For example you can open an 'edit' dialog immediately for a file with:

**symlink-editor /path/to/file**

Which could be used in a right-click context menu for example...
